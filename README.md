# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

Analysis on over 4000 kickstarter projects with data interpretation and visualizations.

The purpose of this analysis is to observe characteristics of successful kickstarter campaigns.

# Conclusions

The data shows that kickstarters for theater projects are much more successful when launched in the summer months.

The data also shows that the size of the goal affects outcome as well: >$1000-$20,000 as well as $35,000-$45,000 had a good chance of succeeding, while campaigns from $20,000-$35,000 had a greater chance of failing - this result surprised me.
